# Alternative CalDAV API Setup

Since Vercel isn't detecting the API functions in the current project structure, here's a simpler approach:

## Option 1: Create New Vercel Project for API Only

1. **Create a new repository** (or use a separate branch):
   - Name: `family-dash-api`
   - Structure:
     ```
     family-dash-api/
     ├── api/
     │   └── calendar.js
     ├── package.json
     └── vercel.json
     ```

2. **Deploy this as a separate Vercel project**
3. **Update the CalDAV client** to use the new API URL

## Option 2: Use a Different Service

Since Vercel is being problematic, we could use:
- **Netlify Functions** (similar to Vercel)
- **Railway** (Node.js hosting)
- **Render** (free tier with functions)

## Option 3: Simplify with CORS Proxy

Use a simple CORS proxy service like:
- `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`
- Or create a minimal Express.js server
